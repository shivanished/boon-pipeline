All three signals show pronounced, periodic oscillations ("bumpy and wavy" lines) that likely reflect the heartbeat. Notably, the red channel consistently has about double the spatial intensity compared to the green and blue channels, while green is slightly higher than blue. This consistent relative difference along with the clear periodic fluctuations indicates that even though the channels are on different scales, the underlying oscillatory pattern (i.e. the heartbeat) is captured in all of them.
